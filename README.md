# DD2424 Deep Learning Project VT19 Group 36

[Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is requrired to run this project. We mainly run and experiment on `GPU` enabled machines.

## Project structure

* [Code](https://github.com/heho07/DD2424Project/tree/master/Code) directory contains the source code of the modal being experimented in this project.

  * [replicating_study_SGD](https://github.com/heho07/DD2424Project/tree/master/Code/replicating_study_SGD) directory contains the modal used in study [Striving for Simplicity: The All Convolutional Net](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6806.pdf).

  * [ALL-CNNC_improved_models](https://github.com/heho07/DD2424Project/tree/master/Code/ALL-CNNC_improved_models) directory contains the improved modal we implemented.

* [ResultsFromtraining](https://github.com/heho07/DD2424Project/tree/master/ResultsFromTraining) directory contins our training && validation results in `.csv` format.

* [WeightsFromTraining](https://github.com/heho07/DD2424Project/tree/master/WeightsFromTraining) directory contains the `weights` saved from running each `epoch` with our training model.

* [Models](https://github.com/heho07/DD2424Project/tree/master/Models) directory contains the `models` saved from running each `epoch` with out training model. Using these it is able to use the model after training has finished.
